          <p>Hello everyone, I am Jahid Khan, age 19 as of 2022 and I am from New Delhi, India.
            I have always an intesrest to learn and write code, I had a pretty good knowledge of
            Python from my school days, so it was easy to grab the concepts of C++. After learning
            some basic concepts of C++ I move on to learn Web-Development in Janauary 2022.
            Then in March, I launched my youtube channel called 'Techy Web Dev' to teach Web-Dev, I upload tutorials and
            various projects made with html, css, js on my channel. In May, after learnning alot of
            front-end development, am currently learning ReactJS(infact I made this portfolio with react). After that I will
            start practicing DSA in C++ and will grab those basic concepts back.
            <br />
            Now, after reading my whole coding journey if you have any questions or feedback
            or just want to talk to me, you can send me a message by going to Contact Page.
            <br />
            Thankyou so much for reading this ðŸ˜Š.
            <br />
